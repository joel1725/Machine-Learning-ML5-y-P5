### USED TOOLS
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Chrome

### IMPORTANT
We recommend use Chrome to display the index.html file. 

The application will show you step by step what you must do to see the final result. 
Anyway, I made a guide.

You must enable the camera of your pc, otherwise it will not work (no data is collected in any server, everything happens in your pc... as it should be).
We recommend you to see it on a PC, this project only has good visualization on screens greater than 1100 pixels wide.
